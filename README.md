# Dice_Game_Higher_or_Lower
Simple program I did for school project that plays a game of dice where you roll dice and have a chance to guess higher or lower and it also allows you to bet on the outcome each round. 
At the begining of the round you can select the number or dice you wish to play with. It will roll the first set of dice, display the total for the first set of dice, and then ask you
if you believe the second roll will be higher or lower than the first. After this it will give you a chance to place a bet on the result. After this the second set of dicce is thrown
we tally up the score and compare to get our winner. It then shows your updated money left to bet with and ask if you wish to play again. The total for money carries over each round
adding some fun and startegy to it. 

This was the first time I had worked in python with the "Try" command and error exceptions. It was cool to see how this works and implement it into the program.
